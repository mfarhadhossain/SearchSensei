   - [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository Using VS Code

You can use Visual Studio Code to clone the repository easily.

1. **Open VS Code**.
2. **Open the Command Palette**:
   - On Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
   - On macOS: Press `Cmd+Shift+P`.
3. **Run "Git: Clone" Command**:
   - In the Command Palette, type `Git: Clone` and select it.
4. **Enter Repository URL**:
   - When prompted, paste the repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/mfarhadhossain/SearchSensei.git
     ```
5. **Select Local Folder**:
   - Choose the local directory where you want to clone the repository.
6. **Open the Cloned Repository**:
   - When prompted to open the cloned repository, click **Open**.

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

In VS Code:

1. **Open a Terminal**:
   - Go to `Terminal` > `New Terminal` in the menu bar.
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In the terminal, ensure you're in the project directory (you should see the path to `SearchSensei`).
   - Run the following command to install all necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Step 3: Set Up the OpenAI API Key

To use SearchSensei, you need a valid OpenAI API key.

1. **Obtain Your OpenAI API Key**:

   - Sign up or log in to your OpenAI account at [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - Generate a new API key.

2. **Update `background.ts`**:

   - In VS Code, open the file `src/background.ts`.
   - Locate the line where the API key is defined:
     ```typescript
     const OPEN_AI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key_here';
     ```
   - Replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` with your actual OpenAI API key (keep it within the quotes):
     ```typescript
     const OPEN_AI_API_KEY = 'sk-...';
     ```

   **Note**: Be cautious with your API key. Do not share it publicly or commit it to any public repositories.

### Step 4: Build the Extension

You have two options:

- **Development Build**:

  - Run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
  - This starts a development build process that watches for changes and bundles files into the `dist` folder.

- **Production Build**:
  - Run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
  - This generates a minimized production build in the `dist` folder.

### Step 5: Load the Extension into Chrome

1. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**:

   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.

2. **Enable Developer Mode**:

   - Toggle the **Developer mode** switch in the top right corner.

3. **Load Unpacked Extension**:

   - Click on **Load unpacked**.
   - In the dialog that opens, navigate to the `dist` folder inside your `SearchSensei` project directory.
   - Select the `dist` folder and click **Select Folder**.

4. **Verify the Extension is Loaded**:
   - You should now see SearchSensei listed among your Chrome extensions.
5. **Pin the Extension**:
   - Locate the extension icon in Chromeâ€™s toolbar, click the puzzle piece icon (extensions icon ðŸ§©), and pin SearchSensei to ensure easy access.
